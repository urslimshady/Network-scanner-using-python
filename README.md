# Network-scanner-using-python

Port scanning can be considered as a monitoring(suvellience) tool which is used in order to locate the open ports available on a particular host.

Types of information that can be expected after running the port scanner.
1. Open Ports informations
2. Operating System informations
3. Services that are running on host


Here are some of the python code snippet to create a port scanner tool using:
1. Socket
2. ICMP(It is not a port scanner, it is used to send ping to check whether the host is up or not)
3. TCP scan
